# Todo-List (https://kalpeshk4970.github.io/Todo-List/)
In this project, I have created a To-Do List that helps the user create a list of things he/she wants to do throughout the day. The technologies employed in this project are HTML , CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The to-do list entries won't be refreshed even if the user refreshes the website since I
utilised JavaScript techniques that make use of local storage.
